# Neural Network Models for Federated Human Activity Recognition (Under Review)

This repository contains the implementations of the neural network models used in our manuscript currently under peer review.

- **FedANN**
- **FedConvNN**

Both models are implemented in `models.py` using PyTorch.

## Contents

* Model architectures (FedANN and FedConvNN)  
* No training or FL pipeline code  
* No dataset

This is shared to support reproducibility during the review process.

## Note

The full codebase will be released after the peer review process is completed.
